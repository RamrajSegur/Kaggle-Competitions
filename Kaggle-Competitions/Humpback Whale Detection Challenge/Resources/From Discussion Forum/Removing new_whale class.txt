1. As there are many different kinds of whales under the class of new_whale, the neural network model is better to be trained using dataset without new_whale class.
2. In order to insert new_whale label back, we could use this idea: if the probability of a class is below a centain threshold, then that class turns to be new_whale. 
3. As most of the bad quality images are labeled as new_whale (except the last one), which would be removed,  we don't need to remove bad images particularly.
